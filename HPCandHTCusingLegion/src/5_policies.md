% HPC and HTC using Legion

Policies
========

## Legion Scheduler

* Tries to give each user an equal share of the machine at any given moment
* Tries to fill gaps with small, short jobs
* Has a few special sets of nodes to run test (short, small) or interactive jobs


## "Production"

Anything that uses:

* a lot of CPU time
* a lot of RAM
* a lot of disk access 

**Production work should be run as a job.**

## Applications Considered Harmful

We reserve the right to ban the use of applications that prevent other users' use of the cluster.


## Extraordinary Resource Requests

* Grab the [form from the website](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/research_services/research-computing/services/legion-upgrade/resource_allocation/#requests)
* Send it to your Consortium Leader to approve
* Send it to us: [rc-support@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk)
* Wait for approval by the CRAG
